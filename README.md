# Rainbow Redstone

This is a fully vanilla compatible resource pack for **any** version 1.13 and above, that makes the redstone dust rainbow (meaning you don't need *any* mods to use this!). Other rainbow components are coming soon (hence this is currently in beta). Check out the gallery to see how this currently looks like!

## Coming soon:
- Full customization of all aspects with [ResPackOpts](https://modrinth.com/mod/respackopts)
- Rainbow redstone components, including repeaters, comparators, torches, etc
- Animations for rainbow effects
- Changes for dust particles with the help of mods
- Still full vanilla compat to the extent that it allows

Pretty much all the code/files for blockstate and models for the dust have been taken from [TCTC Charry](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/tctc-cherry), altho have been modified to suit my needs of wanting purely separate dust and the rainbow aspect of it.
