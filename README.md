# Rainbow Redstone

This is a fully vanilla compatible resource pack for **any** version 1.13 and above, that makes the redstone dust rainbow (meaning you don't need *any* mods to use this!).

**License:** [To be determined - for now ARR]

To be done:
- indorporate v0.5.0 rpo files and stuff into main
- rpo support entirely + re-integration
- rpo color customization
- split between sodium/vanilla game versions to make sure core shaders work
- terrain.fsh to be done for later game versions cuz no rendertype_cutout
- proper liscence - probably custom
-
